    <p>
        Hey everbody! Today we're going to see a simple way to make a web application with ASP.net using Docker containers.
    </p>    
    <ul>                                                                                                                                            
        <li> Docker allows us to create standard packages that with all we need to make a web application work. Docker installs all the dependencies and services required for any operating system (OS). </li>
        <li> Also, Docker has become the most popular package system. All of the OS's manufacturers and suppliers are aware of their capabilities. </li>                                                                                                                   
        <li> With Docker you get consistency and you guarantee that the content placed in a container will run on any computer. If it works in development, it will work in production because with Docker they are the same. </li>
        <li> Docker doesn´t take up much memory and is more scalable than a virtual machine because it only uses the resources required at needs at any one time. </li>
        <li> Another advantage of Docker is that it can be used to unify the development environments and the workflow within them. You do not even have to install the working Software developers kits (SDKs) or compilers on your computer. </li>
        <li> With Docker you can define a work environment based on Docker images for all your work team (different OS) and with this, you can ensure that all members have the same version and everything will work the same file. </li>
        <li> Although Docker was created in, and for, Linux. Its use in .NET and Windows has not stopped growing and is improving its level of service. This is due to the Microsoft team who are working very closely with the Docker team and its developers community. </li>
    </ul>


    <h4 class="margin-top-and-down"> Now let's go to action! The "Step by step guide": </h4>
    <p>
        As always we will show you the requirements needed. It´s necessary to have a text editor and have an operating system with an x64 or x86 architecture installed. <br>

        Well let's get started! <br>

        The first thing we are going to do is install .NET Core 2.1 SDK (or a higher version). To install it, click the following <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download">link</a>. <br>
        
        In the meantime, go make yourself a coffee, the download will take one or two minutes. <br>

        To confirm that .NET Core has properly been installed type the following command: <br>
        <section class="console">
            $ dotnet <br>
        </section>
        You should then see the instructions on how to use .NET Core. If this doesn´t appear try commenting in <a href="https://forums.dotnetfoundation.org/">.NET </a> or <a href="https://forums.asp.net/">ASP</a> forums. <br>

        Then we need to create the directory where you can save the application. Return back to the console to write the following commands: <br>
        <section class="console">
            $ dotnet new webApp -o myWebApp --no-https <br>
            $ cd myWebApp <br>                                                                                                                                    
        </section>
        What do these commands mean-let's break it down. <br> 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> "dotnet new" creates a new application. </li>
        <li> The "webApp" parameter indicates what type or model of application is required. In this case we want a web application. </li>
        <li> "-or" creates a folder called myWebApp where your application will be saved. </li>
        <li> The specific "non-https" flag says that we don´t want to activate https. </li>
        <li> Finally, the "cd myWebApp" command takes us to our new folder. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's time to run the application! <br>


        In the console we need to write: <br>
        <section class="console">
            $ dotnet run <br>
        </section>
        We now need to open the browser and in the address bar enter at http: // localhost: 5000. <br>
        The application is already working!. <br>
        If you want to edit your application you can learn to use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/razor-pages-start?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio">Razor</a>. Here you can change the format, colors and much more. <br>
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="margin-top-and-down">Dockerize the ASP.NET Core application</h3>

    <p>
        Now that we have installed the web application we are going to use Docker simultaneously with .NET Core. <br>

        To begin with docker we have to download it from <a href="https://docs.docker.com/">their page </a>. Then, we need to create a new file a name it “Dockerfile” without any extension. <br>
        Within this file we need to write the following commands. <br>
        <section class="console">
            FROM microsoft/dotnet:2.1-sdk <br>
            WORKDIR /app <br>

            # copy csproj and restore as distinct layers <br>
            COPY *.csproj ./ <br>
            RUN dotnet restore <br>

            # copy and build everything else <br>
            COPY . ./ <br>
            RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o out <br>
            ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "out/Hello.dll"] <br>
        </section>                            
       
        This contains instructions on how to build these run one after each other. <br>

        <br>
        The “FROM” instruction tells the computer to initiate a new build stage and creates the Base image for the following instructions. <br>

        The multi-arch tags pull either Windows or Linux containers depending on the Docker for Windows container mode. The Base Image for our sample is the 2.1-sdk image from the microsoft/dotnet repository, <br>
        

        The WORKDIR instruction sets the working directory for any remaining RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD Dockerfile instructions. If the directory doesn't exist, it's created. In this case, WORKDIR is set to the app directory. <br>
        

        The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from the source path and adds them to the destination container filesystem. With this instruction, we are copying the C# project file to the container. <br>
        

        The RUN instruction executes any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results. The resulting committed image is used for the next step in the Dockerfile. We are running dotnet restore to get the needed dependencies of the C# project file. <br>
        

        The COPY instruction copies the rest of the files into our container into new layers. <br>
        

        We are publishing the app with this RUN instruction. The dotnet publish command compiles the application, reads through its dependencies specified in the project file, and publishes the resulting set of files to a directory. Our app is published with a Release configuration and output to the default directory. <br>
        
        The ENTRYPOINT instruction allows the container to run as an executable. <br>
        
        <br>

        Now you have a Dockerfile that: <br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> copies your app to the image </li>
        <li> your app's dependencies to the image </li>
        <li> builds the app to run as an executable </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 class="margin-top-and-down">Build and run the Hello .NET Core app </h4> 
    <p> 

        These Docker commands are the most used: <br>

        <section class="console">
            docker build <br>
            docker run <br>
            docker ps <br>
            docker stop <br>
            docker rm <br>
            docker rmi <br>
            docker image <br>
        </section>

        Now that we configure the dockerfile, we use Docker to build the app with the containers. <br>
        We need to write this in the console: <br>

        <section class="console">
            docker build -t dotnetapp-dev . <br>
            docker run --rm dotnetapp-dev Hello from Docker <br>
        </section>
        
        Docker build the container following the Dockerfile's instructions. <br>
        After we run the command we should see the following: <br>

        <section class="console">
            “Hello World!” <br>
        </section> 

        Congratulations! We have just: <br>

    </p>
    <ul>                    
        <li> Created a local .NET Core app </li>
        <li> Created a Dockerfile to build your first container </li>
        <li> Built and ran your Dockerized app </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
